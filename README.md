# Horde

Horde is a utility program for making testing web applications at scale à la
[Bees With Machine Guns](https://github.com/newsapps/beeswithmachineguns).

## Requirements

In order to control the Horde you will need:

* The Horde Executable
* Erlang
* An AWS account

## WARNING

"With great power comes great responsibilty."

The Horde is, more-or-less, a distributed denial-of-service attack in a
fancy package. If you point the Horde at any server you don’t own you
are behaving unethically. You will have your Amazon Web Services account locked-out,
and you will be liable in a court of law for any downtime you cause.

You have been warned!
